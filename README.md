# coffee-machine-python-developer
### A simple project involving a coffee machine simulator (as seen on the JetBrains Academy / Hyperskill Python developer plan)

### About
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

### Learning outcomes
This project allows you to get a taste of Python. Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Python.

### Stage 1: Hello, coffee!
Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing!

### Stage 2: Machines have needs
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.

### Stage 3: Enough coffee for everyone
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.

### Stage 4: Action!
Upgrade your knowledge of functions – set the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.
