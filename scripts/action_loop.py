# Description
# Just one action is not so interesting, is it? Let's improve the program so it can do multiple actions, one after another. 
# It should repeatedly ask a user what they want to do. If the user types "buy", "fill" or "take", 
# then the program should do exactly the same thing it did in the previous step. However, if the user wants to switch off the coffee machine, 
# they should type "exit". The program should terminate on this command. Also, when the user types "remaining", 
# the program should output all the resources that the coffee machine has.
#
# Objectives
# Write a program that will work endlessly to make coffee for all interested persons until the shutdown signal is given. 
# Introduce two new options: "remaining" and "exit".
# Do not forget that you can be out of resources for making coffee. If the coffee machine doesn't have enough resources to make coffee, 
# the program should output a message that says it can't make a cup of coffee.
# And the last improvement to the program at this step â€” if the user types "buy" to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind, 
# they should be able to type "back" to return into the main cycle.
#
# Examples
# Your coffee machine should have the the same initial resources as in the example:
# 400 ml of water, 540 ml of milk, 120 g of coffee beans, 9 disposable cups, $550 in cash.
# The greater-than symbol followed by space (> ) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.
#
# Example 1:
# Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
# > remaining
# The coffee machine has:
# 400 of water
# 540 of milk
# 120 of coffee beans
# 9 of disposable cups
# $550 of money
# Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
# > buy
# What do you want to buy? 1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappuccino, back - to main menu:
# > 2
# I have enough resources, making you a coffee!
# Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
# > remaining
# The coffee machine has:
# 50 of water
# 465 of milk
# 100 of coffee beans
# 8 of disposable cups
# $557 of money
# Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
# > buy
# What do you want to buy? 1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappuccino, back - to main menu:
# > 2
# Sorry, not enough water!
# Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
# > fill
# Write how many ml of water do you want to add:
# > 1000
# Write how many ml of milk do you want to add:
# > 0
# Write how many grams of coffee beans do you want to add:
# > 0
# Write how many disposable cups of coffee do you want to add:
# > 0
# Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
# > remaining
# The coffee machine has:
# 1050 of water
# 465 of milk
# 100 of coffee beans
# 8 of disposable cups
# $557 of money
# Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
# > buy
# What do you want to buy? 1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappuccino, back - to main menu:
# > 2
# I have enough resources, making you a coffee!
# Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
# > remaining
# The coffee machine has:
# 700 of water
# 390 of milk
# 80 of coffee beans
# 7 of disposable cups
# $564 of money
# Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
# > take
# I gave you $564
# Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
# > remaining
# The coffee machine has:
# 700 of water
# 390 of milk
# 80 of coffee beans
# 7 of disposable cups
# 0 of money
# Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
# > exit
